# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

  # ChatAI (Beta) 🚀

## Overview
ChatAI is an AI-powered chatbot built using **React.js** and **Gemini AI API**. It is a fully frontend-driven chatbot that provides **intelligent, solution-oriented** responses. Unlike traditional AI chatbots, ChatAI is designed to offer **specific insights** rather than generic replies.

## 🔥 Features
- **AI-Powered Conversations** – Uses **Gemini AI** for generating responses.
- **Frontend-Only Architecture** – No backend required, ensuring quick performance.
- **Lightweight & Fast** – Hosted on **Netlify** for seamless access.
- **Dynamic UI** – Built with **React.js** for an interactive user experience.
- **Postman Tested** – APIs are tested for smooth request-response integration.
- **Custom API Integrations** – Exploring alternative AI models for better performance.

## 💡 Tech Stack
- **React.js** – Interactive UI
- **Gemini AI API** – AI processing
- **Netlify** – Deployment
- **Postman** – API Testing

## 🚧 Challenges & Key Learnings
### 1️⃣ API Testing & Communication Issues
One of the early challenges was **API miscommunication** after updates, causing trigger failures. To resolve this:
- **Postman** was used to validate API requests before integration.
- Extensive debugging ensured smoother API handling.

### 2️⃣ DeepSeek API Security Limitations
- Considered **DeepSeek API**, but frontend apps **expose API keys**, making it unsuitable.
- DeepSeek requires **secure key storage**, which isn’t feasible without a backend.
- Decided to explore **alternative AI models** that fit within a frontend-only setup.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
To run ChatAI locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- A **Gemini AI API key** (or another AI model key)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone [YOUR_REPO_LINK]
   cd chat-ai
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your API key:
     ```sh
     REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
4. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser.

## 🔮 Roadmap & Future Enhancements
🔹 **Enhanced API handling** – Improve request-response efficiency
🔹 **Security enhancements** – Secure API key management strategies
🔹 **Alternative AI models** – Test and integrate other AI solutions
🔹 **Improved UI/UX** – Better user interaction & accessibility
